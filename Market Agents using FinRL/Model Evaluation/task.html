<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">We recommend you to implement the following stages in Google Colab. Before completing this stage, we recommend you to enable GPU in your notebook in Google Colab.</div>
<p>Well done! at this point you have a robust model that has learned to trade based on historical data. In this stage, you'll create a testing environment and validate the model's performance on unseen data to ensure its robustness. This is a crucial step to determine how well the model generalizes to new data and to identify any potential weaknesses.</p>
<p>In this stage, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a testing environment similar to the training environment.</li>
<li>Load the trained policy and apply it to the testing environment.</li>
<li>Validate the model's performance by comparing the results on the test data.</li>
<li>Analyze the results to assess the model's effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of this stage, you will have a clear understanding of the model's performance on unseen data, helping you make informed decisions for further improvements.</p>
<p>You can use this <a href="https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/39679/markets_agents_stage3.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Colab template</a> (recommended) or copy-paste the code below, to complete this stage:</p>

<p> At the end of the stage print the last value of the test portfolio with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># print the final value of the portfolio
final_portfolio_value_test = enviroment_test._asset_memory["final"][-1]
